This was a project that was assigned to me. FSU football coaches wanted to display a still image on the locker room ipads.
Coaches have limited access to the IT server. The access they have allows them to upload an image to the IT office web domain.
The url of the image is then pulled to the application.


It is critical that the image has the same name and file type. Otherwise the app will not run.
To refresh the image the app must be minimized and then opened back up.

Prior to this project I had no knowledge coding in swift. The code is mostly self taught from tutorials.
There were plans to merge this project with the iNoles app for easy access to both apps, this has not been completed yet.
